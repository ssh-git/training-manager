Logging is a simple way to let your application describe its health and operations in a way that is readily consumable by both you and software, and it can provide significant insight when working out bugs. Log4net is one of the most used logging libraries for the .NET platform, with a proven track record going back to 2001. This course is aimed at getting you up and running with log4net, starting with answering the common configuration questions and moving through the entire log4net stack. Included in the course are discussions of effective and advanced logging tactics, such as applying logging through common design patterns and Aspect-Oriented programming. In addition the course demonstrates how you can tap into the modular log4net architecture and extend it with your own code." >Application Instrumentation using log4net</a>

Yet the developer life is filled with jargon, acronyms, and seemingly infinite choices. So how do we know when complexity makes sense? This course discusses when abstractions are justified and outlines the merits of various approaches for structuring applications with a pragmatic, real-world mind set. The discussion begins by outlining philosophies for thinking about architecture and considering the benefits of doing the simplest thing that could possibly work. Then we dive into various design patterns and technologies to consider within the business, service, presentation and data access layers. And in the final capstone module we&#39;ll consider two specific architectures and discuss the contexts where each makes sense. You&#39;ll learn when table module, active record, DDD, and ORMs are useful and walk away with the tools to better evaluate and justify complexity as an agile software craftsman. Like any responsible architect, we&#39;l focus on the value of keeping things simple whenever we can." >Architecting Applications for the Real World in .NET</a>

Humanizer also makes it trivial to convert computerized strings such as Pascal case method names into normal sentences, or turn numeric values into word equivalents.

This course describes how to use the asynchronous programming support in the Task Parallel Library (TPL), which was introduced in .NET 4.0. It also shows how the new language features in C# and Visual Basic fit in with the TPL." >TPL Async</a>

Service-Oriented systems have become mainstream, but designing applications in a service-oriented fashion requires a different look on the components that make it up as well as technologies to support the architecture.

ASP.NET Ajax&#39;s browser-neutral client script library is easily integrated with existing Web applications (including ASP.NET 1.* and non-.NET sites), improving response times and enhancing UIs with DHTML and Javascript features that in the past would have taken enormous development efforts and extensive client-side knowledge. ASP.NET 2.0 applications can take advantage of ASP.NET Ajax&#39;s server-side features to further enhance their UIs, often through simple markup.

Learn how to efficiently optimize your website resources and assets without comprising the way you want to develop. ASP.NET makes bundling and minification incredibly easy and leaves no reason not to ensure your web application is fully optimized. Walk through basic optimization setup against a demo application in both Web Forms and MVC. Then, work to enhance the demo application by adapting the bundling framework for ignoring files, ordering files, and adding CDN scripts with a fallback. You will see how to begin extending the optimization library with your own custom transforms to harness great flexibility. We will take customizations a step further and consider using custom bundles to consolidate and inject resources, enumerations and templates to the client. Finally, we will dive into unit testing your optimization configurations and extensions and the importance of doing so in a team environment." >ASP.NET Bundling, Minification & Resource Optimization</a>

This course is filled with best practices concerning URI design, data shaping, paging, caching, and versioning. It&#39;s very demo-driven, and we start from scratch. It contains an API and two different clients: an ASP.NET MVC client and a mobile client. To top it off, you&#39;ll also learn all about securing both client apps and the API with OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect. The focus is on what works for standardized API development for multiple (possibly cross-platform) clients." >Building and Securing a RESTful API for Multiple Clients in ASP.NET</a>

If you have existing ASP.NET Web Services you are trying to support, you may have realized that it can be difficult to find good information about using them today. In this course you will learn the basics of ASP.NET Web Services and how to use them. We&#39;ll start off by talking about the technology and learning about how ASP.NET Web Services work. Then, we&#39;ll dive in and create our own simple ASP.NET Web Service and learn about how the technology works. Once we have a web service built, we&#39;ll learn how to use .NET&#39;s proxy generating utilities to create a consumer for our web service without writing much code. After that, we&#39;ll learn how to use ASP.NET Web Service in an existing ASP.NET application to provide AJAX functionality and even see how we can embed service methods in ASPX page. Finally, in the last module, I&#39;ll take you through the process of converting a legacy ASP.NET Web Service to newer technologies like WCF and Web API. So, if you need to maintain an existing legacy ASP.NET Web Service application or you are looking to learn enough about ASP.NET Web Service to feel confident in migrating to a newer technology, you&#39;ll want to check out this course." >Introduction to ASP.NET Web Services</a>

Even after understanding what IoC is, a developer must learn to apply the concepts of IoC and IoC containers to a real application in order to use it effectively. In this course, John will show you how to use the Unity IoC container in an ASP.NET MVC 4 application to use dependency injection on controllers, filters, views and more. You’ll start off by learning the basics of IoC containers, how they work and why they are important. As well as, learning about how internally ASP.NET MVC 4 creates controllers and views. In order to understand practically how dependency injection works (the core function of IoC containers)John will walk you through manually doing dependency injection in ASP.NET MVC 4 using your own custom controller factory. After you have done things manually, you’ll see how to add the Microsoft Unity IoC container to your MVC 4 application to do dependency injection automatically. Essentially you&#39;ll see how it is able to give us more flexibility and reduce the custom code we need to write. John then takes things even further by exploring some advanced dependency injection techniques using Unity to inject views and filters. He’ll also cover some of the advanced features of the Unity IoC container. Finally, you’ll take a tour through some other popular .NET IoC containers and see how to get them working in our ASP.NET MVC 4 application. After taking this course you will be equipped with the skills and knowledge you need to build real applications using Inversion of Control and dependency injection." >Practical IoC With ASP.NET MVC 4</a>

Out of the box, Glimpse can show you all kinds of information about your MVC application, like what routes are registered, what the flow was through the MVC pipeline and how the models were bound. In this course I walk you through getting Glimpse set up in your application. Then, I show you how to use the Glimpse tabs to understand what is going on in your ASP.NET application. After that, I&#39;ll take you through the very useful ASP.NET MVC tabs and show you how to diagnose a real problem in an ASP.NET MVC 4 application using glimpse. Once we learn all about Glimpse, it&#39;s time to learn about plugins. In the last two modules of the course, I first show you how to install and use some of the common Glimpse plugins, then I show you how easy it is to actually create your own Glimpse plugin. So, if you are an ASP.NET developer and you haven&#39;t heard of Glimpse, you&#39;ll definitely want to check out this course. It will be well worth your time. And if you have heard about Glimpse, but haven&#39;t felt like you have had the time to learn how to use it, this course will help you to become a Glimpse expert and learn everything you need to know to start using Glimpse in just a few hours." >Using Glimpse With ASP.NET, MVC4, and Entity Framework</a>

Perhaps you already know some Java, but you&#39;ve never build a complete Android application before. Either way, this course has you covered! In this course, you will learn the basics of Java and Android while you create a real working Android application. This course is the third course in a 4 part series on beginning Android development, but you don&#39;t need to watch the other courses to understand this one. As long as you have some basic programming knowledge, you should be able to follow along with this course and build your first Android application using Java and Eclipse. In this course we&#39;ll alternate between learning and doing as we set out to build a note taking application for Android. We&#39;ll start off covering everything you need to know about getting setup to develop an Android application in Java using Eclipse. Then we&#39;ll create our Note Taker application step by step, clearly explaining each step as we go and introducing Java concepts along the way. If you are looking for a new and fun way to learn Java while building an Android application, or you are just looking to maximize your time, by learning two topics at the same time, this course might be just what you are looking for." >Android Beginner Series: Just Enough Java</a>

Perhaps you are brand new to the world of programming and want to learn how to program quickly while doing something fun like developing an Android app? If so, this brand new course series might be just what you are looking for. This is the first course in a series of 4 courses designed to take you from knowing nothing about Android and very little about programming in general to building your own Android apps and games. Here is a breakdown of the courses: course 1: Understanding Android - this course; course 2: Creating Android Apps Without Code Using App Inventor; course 3: Just Enough Java To Build An Android App; course 4: Building a Simple Game In Android. In this first course, we take a look at the very basics of Android and learn exactly what Android is and how it works. This course will go over the design and history of Android. Then we&#39;ll take a look at what exactly an operating system is so that we can better understand the Android operating system and how it works. After that we&#39;ll go over Android applications and exactly what makes them unique. And we&#39;ll finish up the course by talking about all the different ways you can develop Android applications and how the Android app markets work. By the time you finish this course, you should have a solid foundation in Android fundamentals and be ready to start learning how to develop Android applications in the upcoming courses in this series. Whatever your level of programming experience, this course series will get you building your own apps and games in Android quickly, and we&#39;ll have fun doing it. And even if you are already an Android developer, you may find the in depth understanding of how Android works that you will learn from this course valuable." >Android Beginner Series: Understanding Android</a>

Even if you have no interest in Android, you can still watch the course and build a Java based cross platform game. This course is course 4 in the 4 part series on beginning Android development, so this course will assume you already know some Java, but because this course uses a cross platform game library, knowing much about Android is not required. Even if you haven&#39;t watched the other 3 courses in this series, you can still watch this course and learn how to create an Android game in Java. So, are you up for the challenge cadet?

Don&#39;t know Java, don&#39;t know C#, never programmed before? No problem! In this course, you will learn how to use MIT&#39;s App Inventor to create four fully functional apps without writing any code. Along the way, you&#39;ll learn some basic programming concepts that will help you gain the skills you need to be able to program in a language like Java. We&#39;ll start off by learning about App Inventor and how to get it setup. Next, we&#39;ll jump right in and create the follow four real applications: (1) a number guessing game; (2) a simple drawing program; (3) an RPG character creator; (4) Irritated Dolphins (our Angry Birds-like game). If you are looking to get started with Android programming, or programming in general, this course will offer you a gentle introduction to many Android and basic programming concepts and make it fun and easy to learn. And if you are already an experienced developer, but are interested in checking out App Inventor, you&#39;ll probably find this course useful and fun as well. This course is the 2nd course in a four part series on beginner Android development, where we go from not knowing how to code to building real Android application in Java." >Learning to Build Apps with App Inventor</a>

The course also focuses on the data science aspect using Algebird, an abstract algebra library for Scala, to solve real-world sketching/streaming problems on distributed systems. You will learn how to reason about a variety of problems, how to build and test locally, and how to deploy on Hadoop. You will also learn the algorithms used to solve problems at scale where performance, compute and memory resources, and the window of time you have to process streaming data are all challenges you&#39;ll have to overcome, and how you can use Scalding and Algebird to solve for these constraints. This course also covers some Scala basics to get you up to speed and looks into how you can monitor, visualize, and troubleshoot your application&#39;s workflow and performance problems. Watch this course if you were considering, or already know how to use Pig, Hive, or any other DSL for Hadoop and not only wanted more power over your workflows, but also a DSL that is actively being developed to support up and coming execution frameworks like Apache Tez and Apache Spark with all the flexibility that a full functional programming language like Scala has to offer. If you&#39;re serious about learning how to build enterprise-grade applications on Hadoop, data science, and Lambda architectures, then this course is for you." >Data Science & Hadoop Workflows at Scale With Scalding</a>

This information is essential in order to deploy a successful application that does not break under load. The Messaging and Business Process Engines are explained in detail, with a strong emphasis on best practices and an eye on performance. The second part explains the most essential techniques that you will come across in your projects. However, to better understand how these techniques can be used in your real projects, they are explained in the context of a Payment Gateway scenario driven from a real project.

However, most contemporary applications still limit users to exact searches only. For end users, even the standard SQL LIKE operator is not powerful enough for approximate searches. In addition, many documents are stored in modern databases; end users would probably like to get powerful search inside document contents as well. Text mining is also becoming more and more popular. Everybody would like to understand data from blogs, Web sites, and social media. Microsoft SQL Server in versions 2012 and 2014 enhances full-text search support that was substantially available in previous editions.

In spite of the fact that Microsoft decided in 2009 not to build further reporting-tools (but to consolidate the actual portfolio instead) a whole bunch of tools are available and are leading to some confusion through the users: Excel, PowerPivot, Report Builder &amp; Report Designer (Reporting Services), Dashboard Designer (PerformancePoint Services) and Power View. You will take a lap around all of these tools and you will learn when to use which. In this demo-heavy course, the very same report will be built with each of these tools so you can see the strengths and weaknesses of each of them with your own eyes. After finishing the modules, you will be armed with the knowledge to decide which of the tools fits your end-users the best." >Introduction to Microsoft Business Intelligence End-user Tools</a>

In this sequel to C++ Fundamentals, you&#39;ll learn those things. A quick overview of the Standard Library will provide you with collections, algorithms to work with collections, and string manipulation capabilities, as well as signposts to more Standard Library capabilities. Then perhaps the most important C++11 language change, lambdas, are explained and put in context. Finally exceptions, a powerful error-handling technique, are introduced and you will see their significance for resource and memory management. With the modern C++ foundations complete, the last module of this course goes back in time to the sorts of syntax and idioms you&#39;re likely to find in older code, including typedefs, function pointers, void pointers, and C-style strings and arrays. Modern C++ developers must cope with legacy code and this module will show you how." >C++ Fundamentals - Part 2</a>

The DirectComposition API enables you to build the highest-performance native graphics applications using a &quot;retained mode&quot; graphics API. The composition engine retains a visual tree of bitmaps that may be rendered with &quot;immediate mode&quot; graphics APIs such as Direct2D or Direct3D. You get the best of both worlds and can achieve visual effects at a performance level that was never possible prior to the introduction of the DirectComposition API.

Qt Quick is suitable for both desktop and mobile application developers. C++ programmers are the most likely to achieve long term gains from adopting Qt Quick but no knowledge of C++ will be required to understand this course. The ability to understand small snippets of JavaScript will be helpful when watching this course, but not essential. The Qt Quick approach to interface design makes it possible for programmers and designers to work together seamlessly. This course will be using the Qt 5.3 framework and the Qt Quick 2.2 library. If you are new to Qt, please see &quot;Introduction to Qt: A C++ Cross Application Framework&quot; for detailed instructions on downloading and installing the Qt Framework." >Qt Quick Fundamentals</a>

Blogging, Twitter, Github, StackOverflow, User Groups and Conferences: all of this can make you a happier, more productive developer and inspire you to take your career to the next level. You certainly don&#39;t have to be social to be better at writing code - but sharpening your skills this way helps you when it comes time for a job interview, a yearly review where a promotion is on the line, or when you want to start running an Open Source project. For this production we sought out the people who are very active and well known in the social arena: Scott Hanselman and Jeff Atwood talk about blogging, writing, and &quot;working your voice free&quot; so people who read your posts hear you loud and clear. Jon Skeet joins us to talk about what a Good Question is on StackOverflow - and also how you can gain reputation by providing Good Answers - and edits to Good Questions! We venture out to the Portland Area DotNet Users Group (PADNUG) and meet a few developers who have just started going - as well as people who have been there for years. While we were there, Scott gave a 10-minute lightning talk on Azure - a great way to get started speaking if you&#39;re not a fan of public speaking." >Get Involved!</a>

When you need a job, it is important to have good job interviewing skills and know what to expect. The only problem is, it is very difficult to get experience with job interviews, because we don&#39;t do them that often. This course is designed to make you feel much more prepared for a developer job interview by going over the process and talking about many of the types of questions you are likely to encounter. In this course we&#39;ll go over the basics of a job interview and talk about specifically what employers are looking for and how you can improve your resume. I&#39;ll teach you some tricks that increase the chances of you getting an interview greatly. We&#39;ll also go over one of the most difficult and scary parts of a developer job interview, solving a coding question on the spot. I&#39;ll walk you through my own personal technique for solving these types of problem and take you step by step through an example, so that you can gain the skills and experience that will help you feel comfortable to tackle these kinds of problems on your own. Our journey will then takes us through some typical interview questions to help you understand what types of thing you should know and prepare for and the best way to answer these types of questions. Then we&#39;ll go through a blazing fast boot camp for computer science questions about data structures, algorithms, bit manipulation, and concurrency... All the fun stuff you forgot about from college. And finally we&#39;ll wrap up by talking about how you can get experience if you don&#39;t have any, and what kind of experience is valuable. If you are looking for a job currently or just want to brush up on your skills to be prepared, this course might be just for you." >Preparing For a Job Interview</a>

This course is intended to be helpful for individuals who are either beginning their career, moving from another field into technology, or simply updating and compiling a current version of their resume. For beginners, details regarding development of a technical resume from scratch will be covered; for seasoned professionals, the focus will be a review and refinement of an existing resume or CV to meet each individual&#39;s current and unique needs, and an exploration of how your resume is viewed by the reader. We will also explore how resumes are used in the technical industry today, best practices, and why you need bother." >Resume Development for Technical Professionals</a>

Or puzzled over a time when your code added two floating point numbers but the result wasn&#39;t quite correct? If so, then this is the course for you. It aims to teach you the mathematics behind how computers store and manipulate numbers and booleans. You&#39;ll learn, amongst other things, how to read binary and hexadecimal numbers, and why floating point numbers are almost always stored with small errors and how to estimate how big those errors are. You&#39;ll find out how to simplify complex logical expressions, or how to use logical operators and bitwise flags to very efficiently store and manipulate sets of true/false properties. The course also features lots of advice on best practices for working with numerical and boolean data. Underpinning all this, you&#39;ll learn how to see your data the way a computer sees it. And that, when your job involves writing or debugging code that manipulates millions of bytes of data, is a very useful skill to have." >Math For Programmers</a>

The previous introductory course, &quot;Introduction to Machine Learning with ENCOG 3,&quot; laid out a solid foundation of machine learning and neural networks. This course will build upon that foundation for more advanced machine learning implementations. In this course, you will learn about various neural network optimization techniques to overcome the problems of underfitting and overfitting and to create more accurate predictive models. This course will also provide an overall picture of various neural network architectures and reasons for their existence. This course will be focused towards implementation of various supervised feed forward and feedback networks. During the whole course, we will be using open source machine learning framework ENCOG to implement various concepts discussed in this course. Although the implementations in this course are ENCOG-based, concepts discussed in this course are widely applicable in other frameworks or even in custom development." >Advanced Machine Learning with ENCOG</a>

What about setting breakpoints that automatically trigger whenever an AJAX call is made, or whenever a specific element on a page is modified? You can do all this and more with the Chrome Developer Tools, and in this course I&#39;ll show you how. If you&#39;ve seen the Chrome Developer Tools, but just not had the time to really dig into them, or you get the feeling that you are only scratching the surface of what the Chrome Developer Tools can do, this course might be exactly what you need to take your web development abilities to the next level. I&#39;ve found that many web developers are only aware of the basic features of the Chrome Developer Tools, so I&#39;ve structured this course to go over just about every inch of the tools and explain clearly what they do and how you can use them. In this course we&#39;ll cover every one of the 8 panels that exist in the Chrome Developer Tools toolbar. We&#39;ll start off by going over the function of the console, giving you the ability to modify JavaScript objects interactively on the page, debug issues and add helpful log messages with ease. Then, we&#39;ll take a trip to the elements panel where we&#39;ll be seeing how to modify HTML and CSS styles and see the effects immediately displayed on the page. After that, we&#39;ll check out the network panel and how to find out exactly what resources our pages are getting from the network, how long it is taking to get them, and what order all of this is happening in. Then, we&#39;ll head over to the sources panel and unveil the powerful built-in JavaScript debugging capabilities that Chrome has out of the box. (You won&#39;t want to miss this part.) We&#39;ll follow up with a quick review of the audits panel to see how it can give us some handy optimization tips for our pages. Then we&#39;ll dig into the timeline panel where we&#39;ll learn how to figure out exactly what is happening when a page is being displayed and how to optimize our pages to ensure the animation is never choppy. Finally, we&#39;ll wrap things up by seeing how the profiles panel can help us quickly identify performance problems with JavaScript or CSS selectors and also let us see into the scary realm of JavaScript memory management. If you’ve been waiting for the right time to really dig into the Chrome Developer Tools and see what all they can do, that time has come!" >Using The Chrome Developer Tools</a>

I&#39;ll show how you can follow the detective process in order to tackle the toughest of bugs. The case studies range from problematic Windows Services to a complete library system build around WCF and hosted in IIS. Furthermore the library system uses other .NET frameworks (such as EF and ADO.NET) to increase the complexity. Each of the Crime Scenes will tackle a particular bug by utilizing the debugging detective process as well showing the complete analysis of how to arrive at root cause (using a plethora of super useful tools including the native debuggers)." >Debugging Chronicles I</a>

Setting up the infrastructure services Windows Deployment Service (WDS) and Microsoft Deployment Kit (MDT) is imperative to a proper deployment solution. Even if you are not going to deploy images via WDS or MDT, you will find that both are needed and provide invaluable features. Bitlocker pre-provisioning really helps to speed up your deployments, and you&#39;ll learn what other new features are available in Windows 8.1 BitLocker.

It provides all sorts of commands for assisting in Drupal development, automating workflows, and in general making it easier to script various parts of the Drupal workflow. But sometimes the commands that come with Drush or those available from other modules just don&#39;t quite cut it. Sometimes we need to automate things that are specific to our own site. Drush commands can also be useful for one-off data migration tasks and other things for which writing a whole module might be overkill. This course assumes that you&#39;re already familiar with the basics of Drush, that you&#39;ve got it installed on your system already, and that you&#39;re comfortable with running Drush commands provided by core and contrib modules. If you&#39;re not familiar with Drush yet, you might want to start with the Introduction to Drush course, which covers all of the prerequisites for this course." >Coding for Drush</a>

        <a href="/training/Courses/TableOfContents/entity-framework-6-ninja-edition-whats-new" title="Entity Framework 6 brings major improvements to EF that allow developers to align their data access with advanced software practices. The biggest news for EF6 is that it is open-source and has gained a lot from developer community input. Features with broad appeal such as stored procedure mapping in code first, support for the Async/Await pattern when executing queries and commands, simpler patterns for unit testing, and built-in database logging capabilities have gotten a lot of visibility. EF6 is now very extensible with custom Migrations, custom mapping conventions, and the introduction of Dependency Injection patterns to open up low-level DbContext configuration. There are new methods and properties that allow simpler and smarter coding patterns. Rather than present a high level list of the new features, this course dives into each new feature in EF6, ensures that you understand not only what it is for, but how it works, scenarios where you can benefit from it, and gotchas you should watch out for. This course provides a comprehensive look at what EF6 adds to Entity Framework, and it will leave you with the ability to truly benefit from all of the Ninja power that&#39;s been added to this version of EF." >Entity Framework 6: Ninja Edition - What's New in EF6</a>

        <a href="/training/Courses/TableOfContents/creating-chrome-extensions" title="Chrome is an awesome browser from Google that is very fast and lightweight, yet also very powerful. Chrome also has a very good extensibility model that allows developers with just HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills to create powerful extensions. In this course, I’ll show you the basics of creating Chrome extensions as we create 3 different Chrome extensions. We’ll start off the course learning a little bit about the basics of Chrome extensions and how extensions work in Chrome and then we’ll dive right in and start creating our first extension. Once we have the basics down, we’ll build a more powerful extension that has its own user interface and options page and is able to save data using the Chrome APIs and add its own entry to the right click menu for Chrome. Then, we’ll learn to create a page action extension which will only show up on certain web pages. We’ll also learn how to utilize the Chrome messaging API and even how to inject our own JavaScript and CSS into an existing page to enhance its capabilities. We’ll actually have our extension modify the Pluralsight website course listing page to make the course listing table sortable—so, you won’t want to miss this. Finally, we’ll wrap up our tour of Chrome extensions by learning how to debug extensions as well as deploy them. So, if you are interested in Chrome extensions, but have always thought it might be too difficult to create one for yourself, you definitely need to check out this course. Trust me, it is much easier than you probably think and this course will show you how to do it." >Creating A Chrome Extension</a>

How can you avoid having to pay exorbitant amounts for licenses, or wasting money through over-provisioning a server? This course answers all these questions and more. The course begins be explaining basic server terminology, and then explains how to decode Dell and HP server model numbers, along with Intel and AMD processor numbers so you can figure out what current servers and components you have. It then describes and demonstrates the common application, processor, memory, and disk benchmarks you can use to evaluate the performance of your current and new servers. After that, it explains all the choices you need to make when choosing a new server so that you make the best use of your hardware budget, considering the anticipated workload plus OS and application licensing limitations. Finally it covers how to maintain your servers, including how to limit maintenance downtime using high-availability technology, and then how to maximize your hardware budget through negotiation tactics, consolidation, and virtualization. This course is perfect for beginners with little knowledge of server hardware, through developers, DBAs, managers, and other IT professionals who need to understand how to successfully evaluate and provision new servers" >Understanding Server Hardware</a>

In this course I&#39;ll walk you through the creation of a real application using the Kinect. We&#39;ll be building a Fruit Ninja clone called Shape Ninja which will be capable of detecting chopping gestures and responding to audio commands. We&#39;ll start off by learning a little bit about the Kinect itself and the Kinect SDK. Then, I&#39;ll show you just how easy it is to get color image and depth data from the Kinect. We&#39;ll make our application be able to detect and respond to a chopping gesture. And, we&#39;ll wrap things up by learning how to use the Microsoft Speech Platform SDK in combination with the Kinect&#39;s audio sensors to implement real voice commands for our application. If you&#39;ve been waiting for the opportunity to check out the Kinect, but you didn&#39;t know where to start or perhaps you thought it would be difficult to learn, this course will get you up and running with the Kinect in no time." >Building a Real Application With Kinect</a>

The Leap Motion is a new type of user interface device that allows for very precise tracking of up close motions. The Leap Motion opens up the possibility for creating completely different kinds of applications that are able to be controlled by fingers, hand gestures and even tools like a pencil. This course will teach you everything you need to know to get started developing application for Leap Motion in C#. First you’ll learn a bit about motion tracking in general and how the Leap Motion works. We’ll discuss how the Leap Motion device is unique from many other motion tracking technologies. Then, we’ll go through the basics of the Leap Motion itself and you’ll learn how to get started and setup your development environment for developing a Leap Motion application. After that, we’ll take you through the process of creating a real WPF application that uses the Leap Motion controller for tracking movement. You’ll learn how to use the Leap Motion SDK to create code to track individual finger movements and gestures and how to map those movements to screen coordinates to control an object on the screen. Finally, we’ll take you through the process of bringing your Leap Motion application to the masses as we show you how to deploy your application to the Leap Motion Airspace store. By the end of this course, you’ll have built a complete application that can be controller with a Leap Motion controller." >Developing for Leap Motion in C#</a>

By understanding Document Flow, you&#39;ll be empowered to make better decisions when writing HTML, and be able to write more efficient CSS that uses the default behavior of elements to your advantage.

Among many other features, your finished site includes support for the canvas, drag and drop, new input types, geolocation, SVG, CSS3, audio, media, and much more.

And it is actually much easier than you think, especially now that you can develop games completely using web technologies you probably are already familiar with. Modern browsers today that have support for HTML5 and fast JavaScript engines are more than capable of running complex games that would have been impossible years earlier. In this course, I’ll show you how to create a complete game using only HTML5 and JavaScript. We’ll start off by learning the basics of game development and the basics of how HTML5 and modern browser technologies support it. Then, we’ll dive right in and start implementing the basics of a game. We’ll start off by actually creating the start of a game completely from scratch, implementing everything ourselves. Once we’ve seen the basics of doing things from scratch, we’ll introduce a JavaScript game engine to help us out as we learn about Quintus and start building our first real complete game. From there on we’ll expand our game little by little as we add features like moving a player around and firing shots in the game. We’ll also learn how to create enemies in the game and give them some intelligence. So, if you are interested in game development or if you just want to see what is possible with HTML5, check out this course. You’ll be surprised how easily you can put together a real HTML5 game." >Beginning HTML 5 Game Development With Quintus</a>

In this course I’ll teach you the basics of Firefox OS and show you by example how to create two real Firefox OS applications as well as how to get those applications into the Firefox Marketplace. In this course, we’ll start off by learning a little bit about Firefox OS and what makes it different. We’ll also talk about some of the benefits of a mobile operating system that uses web technologies you are already familiar with and take a quick look at the OS itself. After that, we’ll create a very basic Hello World application as we go through the pretty simple process of installing the Firefox OS simulator and creating a very basic application to run inside it. Once we have those basics down, we’ll go straight into creating our first application. First, I’ll show you how to create a hosted application which is an application that you can actually host on your own webserver, but is installed like any other mobile app on Firefox OS. Then, we’ll create another full application, as we learn how to create a packaged application that is able to access more of the APIs that Firefox OS only exposed to apps that are actually installed on the device. We’ll still use the same HTML 5 technologies you are used to for this application, but we won’t need to host the app ourselves, because the user will install in directly on their device. Finally, I’ll take you through the process of deploying your Firefox OS applications. We’ll talk about the different options you have for getting our application into users hands including distributing it yourself and using the Firefox Marketplace to host your apps. So, if you are excited about mobile, and want to learn about an exciting platform you can develop for that will allow you to reuse your existing HTML 5, JavaScript and CSS skills, you’ll definitely want to check out this course." >Beginning HTML5 Apps For Firefox OS</a>

        <a href="/training/Courses/TableOfContents/taking-leap-flash-html5" title="Adobe Flash technology has long been the de facto solution for delivering video on the web. From a programming standpoint, it just worked. With ever-growing fragmentation, shifting standards, and lack of Flash support on mobile devices, the industry is currently in flux. HTML5 has emerged as an open source alternative to Flash for video playback, with a growing feature set, support across mobile, and an energized developer community surrounding it. HTML5 is really still in its infancy (well, perhaps adolescence) and its features are still not on par with Flash. But that doesn’t mean it’s not a good way to play video online. In this course, I’ll show you how to achieve the same basic video-related tasks in Flash and in HTML5. Through simple side-by-side examples, you’ll be able to compare the technologies and see the strengths and weaknesses of each, and hopefully remove a few bumps from your transition path." >Taking The Leap from Flash to HTML5 Video</a>

But, it doesn’t have to be a painful experience. In this course, I’ll show you the basics of creating an iOS application as we build a complete iOS application learning what we need to know about Objective-C along the way. We’ll start out by learning a little bit about iOS in general and the iOS development environment. Then, we’ll jump right in and create out first Hello World iOS application as we set up our development environment and learn the basics of the IDE we use for iOS development, Xcode. After that, I’ll show you the core things you need to know to build any application, how to build a user interface and interact with it. We’ll learn how to use Xcode’s Interface Builder tool to create a very basic IU and interact with it. Once we’ve got the basics covered, we’ll start building our first real application. We’ll learn a few new concepts as we build our application, like how to use the iOS storyboarding feature to creating a multi-screen application and how to setup navigation in our application. Finally, we’ll finish up our iOS application by learning how to add user settings to the app and how to show the user a simple notification through the use of alerts. So, if you are looking to get started with iOS development and are looking for an easy and gentle way to get introduced to the environment and tools while building a real application, this course is exactly what you need. You won’t be an expert at iOS development after taking this course, but this course will definitely give you a head start in learning the platform and show you the basics you need to know before taking a more advanced course." >Beginning iOS 7 Development</a>

        <a href="/training/Courses/TableOfContents/practical-ios-concurrency" title="This course demonstrates practical techniques for adding concurrency to your iOS apps in order to increase responsiveness and more fully utilize the iPhone and iPad hardware. You&#39;ll build a solid foundation for using the concurrency APIs by learning how to create and use blocks in Objective-C. You&#39;ll learn to use a number of the functions in Apple&#39;s Grand Central Dispatch API and how to send code blocks to dispatch queues for both synchronous and concurrent execution. You&#39;ll also learn how to use operation queues and how they differ from dispatch queues and when you might choose one over the other. The last module will focus on how to create your own NSOperation subclasses to encapsulate tasks to be executed on operation queues. Performing work concurrently doesn&#39;t have to be hard and the APIs provided by Apple have made it easier than ever to take advantage of modern multi-core processors. This course will show you how." >Practical iOS Concurrency</a>

        <a href="/training/Courses/TableOfContents/apache-camel-intro-integration" title="This course is designed as an introduction to using Apache Camel. Camel is one of the most popular open-source frameworks targeted at solving integration problems. Camel realizes standard, well-established Enterprise Integration Patterns, or EIPs. In this course, we will cover several of these EIPs, as they are vital for Camel implementations. I will show you how to use these patterns as we add Camel to a case study project, a Java application for processing order fulfillment. I chose this scenario because it captures a common problem that developers face: best practices for integration are commonly an afterthought during initial implementation. In our scenario, the fulfillment processor sends orders to one fulfillment center. The product owner wants to add a new method for fulfillment, but the new fulfillment endpoint has a different message structure and different rules for processing than the current one. You will see how we can introduce Apache Camel to increase the cohesion of the components in the processor and decrease the on-boarding time of future fulfillment endpoints. Through patterns such as pipes and filters, message routing, message endpoints, and message translation, we will implement processing to a new fulfillment center using Camel as the primary means of integration. By taking this course, you will gain foundational knowledge of Apache Camel. You will learn about the architecture, including CamelContext, routing, endpoints, and components. You will see what it takes to add Apache Camel to a project. You will see how Camel implements standard EIPs and usage examples that leverage the patterns. Finally, you will learn how to test and debug Camel routes. This course is primarily intended for developers who are looking for a framework to solve integration problems and/or are interested in Apache Camel as a framework. It will also be useful for technical and solution architects who are investigating technologies to leverage for implementing integration. It is recommended that you are proficient with Java and knowledgeable in Spring before taking the course. While viewing the course, you will be able to easily follow along with the demonstrations, each of which will build on the previous demonstration for a fluid experience. It is recommended that you download the initial case study application into your IDE prior to starting the course." >Introduction to Integration With Apache Camel</a>

        <a href="/training/Courses/TableOfContents/hibernate-introduction" title="In the world of Java, one of the most popular and widely used frameworks is Hibernate. Hibernate is an ORM, or Object Relational Mapper, that allows developers to map Java objects to relational database tables. It is a valuable tool that all Java developers should know how to use. The problem is, learning Hibernate can be difficult. Hibernate is a very large framework and there are many important concepts to understand to use it effectively. This course is designed to make getting started with Hibernate as easy as possible and focus on the most important things you need to know. We start off this course by learning a bit about Hibernate and how it works, and then see how to get it setup with a real MySQL database installation. After that, we learn the very basics of mapping, which is one of the most important things to understand about Hibernate. I&#39;ll show you how to create a basic mapping for a Java object to a relational table and explain to you how the mapping works. But most real world applications have more complex mapping that often trips up new developers and experienced developers alike. So, we&#39;ll also cover some of the complex mapping situations like mapping collections and different relational mappings like one-to-many and many-to-one. Once you&#39;ve learned how to map you objects, you&#39;ll want to know how to query them, so I&#39;ll show you how to do this using Hibernate&#39;s built in HQL and using a more object oriented approach with the Criteria API. Finally, we&#39;ll wrap things up by taking a brief tour of some of the more advanced features like caching and interceptors. So, if you are wanting to learn how to use Hibernate, or if you&#39;ve been struggling through using Hibernate in an existing application, but never really understood what was going on, this course will give you the knowledge you need to feel confident about how Hibernate works and how to use it." >Introduction To Hibernate</a>

Do you have constant battles between the .NET side and the Java side, because of the competition between the two? Perhaps you just have to work in both environments and wish there was a way to reuse some of your code from Java in .NET or .NET code in Java? This course will give you solutions to help with all of those problems. In this course we&#39;ll take a look at how you can make your Java and .NET code talk by utilizing 3 different technologies. First, we&#39;ll use IKVM.NET to convert Java directly to .NET, which will allow you to use Java libraries in your .NET applications and even write Java applications in .NET. Then, we&#39;ll use JNBridgePro to bridge directly between .NET and Java and allow you to communicate between .NET and Java applications while still running each in their own environment. Finally, I&#39;ll introduce you to RabbitMQ for creating a message based service that allows for not only Java and .NET to interoperate, but also any other language that can send messages to RabbitMQ. So, if you&#39;ve been considering rewrite a Java application as a .NET application or a .NET application as a Java application, but have been thinking there has to be a better way, this course might be just what you are looking for. Or if you are in an environment where both Java and .NET are used, but seldom talk to each other, this course can help you to learn about tools you can use to get both sides talking, letting you walk away a hero." >Making Java And C# Work Together: JVM and .NET CLR Interop</a>

It&#39;s even bigger than Java 5 that saw the introduction of generics. We&#39;ll begin with lambda expressions and the Stream API, which bring new fundamental patterns to the Java platform. Many problems solved with the Iterator pattern are now solved much more efficiently with the patterns brought by the Stream API. But Java 8 is not only about lambdas, streams and collectors, there is also a new Java Date and Time API which are covered in this course. This API fixes all the flaws of the previous Date/Calendar API and brings new, very useful, concepts and tools. Many new features that bring a functional programming approach have been added to the Collection API. This is also covered in detail. Many more things are covered; little things, scattered here and there in the JDK, like this new StringJoiner class, useful to join strings with a prefix, a postfix, and a separator. JavaFX and Nashorn are also quickly covered, to show the FXML way to describe Graphical User Interfaces, and the new ways to describe JavaFX in Javascript using Nashorn." >What's New in Java 8</a>

We explore Jersey&#39;s built-in dependency injection, and improve our API to take advantage of Jersey&#39;s async support. We switch from the built-in MOXy library in favor of Jackson to render our highly-tailored JSON and XML, and build a custom MessageBodyWriter along the way. We explore mapping exceptions to responses, and supporting conditional GET requests. We implement our own PATCH verb, and along with it, support for conditional updates as well.

This course takes AngularJS developers beyond the fundamentals to address that next level of problems you encounter. You&#39;ll see familiar patterns such as Separation of Concerns (SoC) are at the heart of building solid AngularJS applications. You&#39;ll learn techniques to organize code and the right questions to ask yourself that can shape your application patterns. Other topics include: how to extend application design from small, to medium, to large scale apps with many modules, naming conventions, controller techniques, reusable services, creating reusable building blocks, dependency injection, and build automation. By the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of how to write clean code with AngularJS to create greater implicit readability, make it easier to maintain, and extendable.

Over time, it has evolved through a philosophy of stable, measured growth to become an extremely powerful framework for developing line of business applications. Due to its vast size, however, Dojo has a fairly steep learning curve, especially on your own. This course is designed to introduce Dojo one step at a time, and show how the toolkit&#39;s modular approach can be used to build applications. Beginning with a server-rendered application, Dojo is first layered in to provide some simple client-side validation.

You&#39;ll need to query web services to retrieve the data for presentation, let the user edit the data, and push those changes to the server. And if you are going for a rich, stateful, interactive user experience, you won&#39;t want to be doing full page post backs to get that done. To work with the data on the client side, you&#39;ll need change tracking and validation of edits, the ability to filter, sort, and page data from the client side. You might need to work with that data offline as well. Breeze.js is a JavaScript library that does all of that for you. Breeze lets you quickly develop a good layered architecture on the client side in JavaScript, acting as a data layer, repository, or data gateway for your client side code. This course will walk you through all of the core features of Breeze. You&#39;ll learn how to execute queries from your client side JavaScript to retrieve data for presentation, work with the cached data on the client side, enable rich editing scenarios, handle changes to the data client side, validate that data, and send changes back to the server side. You&#39;ll see how to set up the services using ASP.NET Web APIs and how to work with OData services." >Building Data-Centric Single Page Apps with Breeze</a>

Data will be managed on the server side by ServiceStack, which will provide a web service and API as well as dependency injection through an Inversion of Control container that will provide ORMLite, a light-weight Object Relational Mapper. Client side data will be managed by Breeze. Bootstrap will provide a much cleaner and more professional UI design than might otherwise be available.

Fortunately, browsers are now capable of displaying SVG: scalable vector graphics. SVG is great for controls, visualizations, and graphs that were previously only possible with proprietary technologies like Adobe Flash. And mobile devices that can display SVG will see crisp graphics at every resolution. In this course, you&#39;ll benefit from tips and tricks we&#39;ve learned from over a decade of working with drawing systems, and several years of working with Raphael. We&#39;ll show you how to work with both simple objects and complex paths. Whether you&#39;re a back-end database developer or a front-end designer, you&#39;ll become confident with basic drawing, text, animation, and interaction that&#39;s now available to you with the straightforward API of Raphael.js and the open standard of SVG." >Meet Raphael.js</a>

Unfortunately, since Meteor is so new, there isn’t a large amount of information available to learn how to develop applications with it. This course is designed to take you through the full process of developing a complete single page application in Meteor using JavaScript and deploying that application to a real production system. We’ll start off by learning about what Meteor is and learning about the technologies that Meteor uses. Then, we’ll dig deep into Meteor to demystify the “magic” around it and discover how Meteor is able to do so much with so little code. Then, we’ll actually create our first Meteor application and along the way we’ll cover some of the code concepts of Meteor needed to create a basic Meteor application. Once we have the basics down, we’ll expand our application and discover some of the more advanced concepts of the platform that really allows us to utilize the power of Meteor. Finally, we’ll go beyond Meteor as we learn how to deploy our application to both the Meteor servers and a Linux machine in the cloud and also discover how to use community created extensions to do things like add routing to our application. So, if you are interested in Meteor and want to see how you can create single page applications entirely in JavaScript with relatively little code, compared to other solutions, check out this course." >Meteor.js Fundamentals for Single Page Applications</a>

Javascript is a highly dynamic language with many interesting features which most developers never learn. Yet familiarity with Javascript is a must if you want to develop current web applications with the full power of modern browsers. The Prototype.js library makes Javascript nearly painless. It extends native objects with extra functionality and makes it easy to organize your code or even extend built-in objects. If you&#39;re a Rails developer, it&#39;s time to learn the magic behind the Javascript libraries that ship with Rails. You may even find yourself taking advantage of the power or Prototype instead of using the Rails helpers that insulate you from the process! If you want to use Prototype with another server-side framework, you&#39;ll learn the client-side basics you need to be confident with Ajax." >Prototype.js Fundamentals</a>

Being able to see these tasks completed in different Linux flavors will help you understand which Linux distribution is best for you, and prepare you for the vendor neutral certification for the LPI (Linux Professional Institute). This is an administration course, so basic concepts of system administration are expected, but prior knowledge of Linux or Unix systems is not required. We at Pluralsight would like you to again understand the enjoyment that system administration once gave you." >Linux Installation and Initial Configuration</a>

In this course, we look at monitoring, networking, and system messages which relate to the exam objective 200, 205, and 206. Starting with monitoring, the course will guide you through data collection with the package sysstat before looking at graphical representation with collectd. With that done, we learn to monitor services with Nagios. Then we look at Networking and even configure our own Wireless Access Point. With networking done, we turn to Bacula as a backup solution on the network and look at how we can message users who refuse to log off. This is a full and descriptive course for the Network Administrator who is looking for that next step." >Linux Monitoring and Maintenance (LPIC-2)</a>

Starting with Office 2007, Microsoft introduced a new file format, the Open XML File formats, that stores the content of Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents in an XML-based structured set of folders inside a standard ZIP file. The Open XML File formats are easy to use, easy to view, and far easier to work with than the previous binary formats. The XML content is, however, somewhat daunting to manipulate programmatically, and Microsoft has released the Open XML SDK to make it simpler. This course focuses both on examining and understanding enough about the Open XML File formats to get you started, and shows several examples using the Open XML SDK with each type of supported document. You&#39;ll learn to both retrieve and modify data in an example for each type of document. By the time you&#39;re done with the course, you&#39;ll have a basic understanding of the tools you need, and the locations for finding help." >Introduction to Microsoft Office Open XML</a>

The course assumes you don&#39;t have any infrastructure in place, and starts by discussing the accounts that you will need in order install SQL, SharePoint, and Project Server in a secure manner ready for a production environment. This is followed by the installation of SQL Server and its configuration, and then the installation of the pre-requisites of SharePoint, and finally, the SharePoint install itself. Once both of these products are installed, Project Server can be installed, and the SharePoint Configuration Wizard run (and appropriate troubleshooting steps taken), before finally configuring the SharePoint Farm and creating an new Project Web App instance. In the final two modules, the course shows you how to wire up Excel Services and the Secure Store Service in order to run the Out Of The Box Excel reports, and then create and publish a new Project to finally verify that everything is working and configured properly. This course contains lots of resources to enable the user to follow best practices and obtain further information." >Project Server 2013 Installation</a>

In this course, I’ll take you through the complete process of creating an application that works on each of the platforms and uses a REST based backend API to share data and business logic—all using C#. We’ll start off this course by learning how to build a REST based API using the popular open source framework ServiceStack. I’ll show you how easy it is to get ServiceStack set up and even how to store data for the API using a Redis database. Next, I’ll show you how to create an ASP.NET MVC 4 application that uses the REST service we built to display it&#39;s data and implement it&#39;s logic. We’ll learn how to use JQuery to make AJAX calls to a REST based API from within our MVC 4 application. Then, we’ll learn how we can use C# and the .NET framework to build an Android application using the Xamarin tools. We’ll use the same REST API, we created earlier and build a real native Android application that is able to consume that API for implementing its logic and displaying data. Finally, I’ll show you how to do the same thing for an iOS application. We’ll again use C# to build a real native iOS application with the Xamarin tools and learn how to consume REST based web services from iOS. So, if you are a C# developer and don’t want to have to learn several other programming languages to build cross platform applications; you’ll definitely want to check out this course. By the end of this course, you’ll have the skills you need to be able to implement an end-to-end cross platform solution complete with a REST based API backend all in C#." >An MVC4, iOS And Android App With ServiceStack, Xamarin and C#</a>

Built on top of AngularJS, developers are able to leverage all of their pre-existing AngularJS skills when working with the Ionic Framework, considered by many to be the &quot;Bootstrap for mobile.&quot; In this course, we will see how to quickly get up and running with an Ionic app in seconds. We will then cover navigation and routing, followed by demonstrations of all the primary Ionic components. We will also cover data and caching for offline functionality, as well as mapping and providing driving directions. We will finish with a review of ngCordova to easily access native device features such as the camera, barcode scanner, and more.

Even though there are many solutions today for cross platform development on these platforms, many of the solutions either require you to use a single non-native user interface or create your user interface code multiple times. Appcelerator Titanium is an exciting way to build truly native Android and iOS applications using JavaScript which are able to reuse a large amount of code, even for the user interface. In this course, I&#39;ll take you through the process of getting setup with Appcelerator Titanium and fill you in on all the details of how exactly Titanium works and why it is so different than many other cross platform solutions. Throughout this course, we&#39;ll actually build a real mobile application that will run on both Android and iOS using Appcelerator Titanium and along the way learn about the platform and how to use it. We&#39;ll start off learning how to programmatically create a cross platform user interface in JavaScript and how to interact with the user interface and respond to events like button clicks. Then, we&#39;ll learn a bit about the different platform APIs that Titanium provides and how to expand our app to take into account multiple screens. After that, we&#39;ll learn about Alloy, a way to build Titanium applications using XML markup and style sheets using an MVC or Model View Controller approach, which can greatly simplify our code and make it much easier to design an application. Finally, in the last module, we&#39;ll tackle a few advanced concepts and learn about the awesome Titanium Cloud API, which allows us to create a full backend for our application without having to install any databases or design any complex schemas. So, if you are interested in cross platform application development and you&#39;d like to see how you can build truly cross platform native applications using JavaScript, you&#39;ll definitely want to check out this course." >Cross Platform Android and iOS Apps With Appcelerator Titanium</a>

The demand for mobile applications will most likely continue to grow at an exponential pace for the foreseeable future. But mobile users, like their web and desktop counterparts, demand just as much quality as quantity, maybe more. Cross platform solutions like Xamarin reduce both time to market and the amount of code needed to target multiple platforms. To support this rapid development pace, while also ensuring high quality, more and more mobile teams are turning to automated build, testing, and deployment strategies. While there are many different solutions available, this course attempts to illustrate an interesting and compelling alternative for the Xamarin shop looking to leverage in-house .NET skills using modern tools like F#/FAKE and TeamCity, as well as 3rd party cloud services such as HipChat and PagerDuty." >Xamarin Continuous Integration Using TeamCity and FAKE</a>

This involves understanding Spanning Tree Protocol, which is a simple solution to prevent layer 2 loops, yet can create complex topologies, and potentially a slow converging network, which can cause issues for our users. We will look at how Spanning Tree Protocol operates, and then examine how it converges on a real network. Then we dive into looking at how we can modify the Spanning Tree Protocol topology and improve performance. Additionally, we will perform an IOS upgrade on a router and a switch, and even cover how to fix an upgrade gone awry. Also, you will learn how to change the password on a router or a switch when you do not know the password." >Cisco CCNA: Advanced Ethernet and File Management</a>

The course begins with a discussion on common wireless attacks, demonstrates how you can detect these attacks, and describes the countermeasures you can put in place to protect your network. Rogue access points, DoS, and use of public hotspots are covered. The course then details the different security mechanisms defined in the 802.11 specifications, starting with the different encryption options, including the risks associated with using WEP and TKIP, and the transition to AES. There is an in-depth look at the different authentication mechanisms, including MAC, 802.1x, and Web-based authentication. The course concludes with a detailed discussion on TKIP and CCMP message authentication, and the new 802.11w mechanism that protects management frames. Details on the security changes made to support the new 802.11ac very high throughput standard are also covered." >Implementing Wireless Security in a BYOD Environment</a>

Since it is a community-supported application, it is free to users! In this series, we will walk through all of the basics you need to get yourself familiar with what Wireshark is doing, as well as how you can use Wireshark to examine the operation of network protocols. First, we will examine what Wireshark is doing during a packet capture, and then we will move into some of the options available to capture traffic, including capturing traffic on more than one interface, as well as using the command line interface on systems to capture traffic. Next, since Wireshark parses out the headers of each piece of data it captures, you&#39;re able to examine the header at each layer of communication. In this series, we will take a look at ARP, ICMP(used for Ping), TCP, HTTP, DNS, Telnet, and SSH." >Introduction to Wireshark</a>

He started howtonode.org where many people learned how to use early versions of Node.js. He now works at Cloud9, a browser-based IDE. He has authored over a hundred open source projects. We gave Tim the task of building a simple function that parses directions, durations, and distances from a set of instructions for trail hikers. He built a simple Node.js web app to demonstrate the feature. You&#39;ll see Tim work with: lightweight, high performance Node.js web servers (his final app runs in only 1ms!), building middleware, writing a test suite with built-in modules, using Apache bench for benchmarking, adding structure to an application as it develops, debugging, and the good feeling of writing Open Source software." >Play by Play: Tim Caswell</a>

In this course, you will begin to understand exactly what Redis is and how Redis works. You will walk through 5 data structures of Redis that will help you to understand how each data structure works and when you might use it. John will show you how to install Redis, both on a Windows machine for learning and testing and on a real Linux server for production use. You&#39;ll also learn about the ServiceStack.Redis C# client for accessing Redis from C# code. Finally, John will take you through the process of creating a real application with Redis and ASP.NET MVC4 as we put what we learned into practice. The purpose of this course is to take you from being hesitant to learning this database, to confident in building a complete application using Redis as a backend." >Building NoSQL Apps With Redis</a>

Attention is also paid to best practices for keeping the site secure.

Obviously creating groups and policies to execute this kind of fine-grained control would be burdensome. The JEA toolkit promises a much easier way to accomplish this. JEA is a PowerShell toolkit that creates special sessions to grant User Accounts &quot;run-as-administrator&quot; permissions on commands, properties and settings they need to manage network resources.

The central design mantra in PowerShell is Think-Type-Get. That is: Think what you want, Type it, and Get the results. Unfortunately this mantra doesn&#39;t always work - PowerShell combines concepts from other languages (Perl, Python, and VBScript for example) and borrows ideas from other platforms (like pipelining in Bash). This creates an experience that feels familiar, but fails to behave consistently with our experiences.

In this course we will cover most of the Go programming language and look at some of the neat things we can do with Go. We&#39;ll progressively cover each important concept in the language and finally end by looking at concurrency (which is built into the language.) If you are looking for an extremely fast an efficient language that is an elegant replacement for traditional systems programming languages like C or C++, Go might be just what you are looking for. Go allows you many of the benefits of powerful low level languages, but is very easy to use and designed with today&#39;s programming environment in mind.

Many developers are surprised to find that even very popular games like Angry Birds are written in Lua. In this course, you’ll learn how to quickly get started writing programs and scripts with Lua. I’ll take you through the basics of Lua, show you some tricks that demonstrate the Lua’s flexibility and even show you how to use Lua in an object oriented way. We’ll start off in this course by learning a bit about Lua itself and Lua’s history, as well as learn how to download Lua and use the popular SciTE IDE for creating and running Lua code. After we are setup and ready to develop some Lua code, we’ll learn the basics of Lua as we jump right in and build our first application. We’ll go over Lua’s type system and learn how to assign variables, utilize operators, use conditional logic and create loops. Once we’ve got the basics covered, we’ll explore two powerful concepts in Lua: functions and tables. We’ll learn how functions work in Lua and what makes them so powerful, and we’ll see how tables can be used for more than just storing simple data. Even though Lua itself doesn’t have a class construct, we’ll learn how to do object oriented programming in Lua using tables and metatables. Finally, we’ll wrap up the course by learning a little bit about the standard libraries that come with Lua. I’ll show you some examples of using some of the most useful functions in the standard libraries and show you where you can get more information about them." >Beginning Lua</a>

        <a href="/training/Courses/TableOfContents/introduction-building-web-applications-dart" title="Dart is an exciting new programming language from Google which is designed to eventually replace JavaScript. Dart is an optionally typed language, meaning that it can be as dynamic as JavaScript, but it also has a type system which can give you the benefits of languages like C# and Java. In fact, you&#39;ll find that if you already know Java or C#, Dart will seem very familiar to you, since it takes some of the best features of those languages and much of their syntax. Many C# and Java developers find they can start writing Dart code with a very short learning curve. You&#39;ll also find that you can start using Dart right now, because Dart code can compile down to standard JavaScript which can run anywhere. In this course, I&#39;ll take you through Dart and the Dart platform, and show you the basics of the language. We&#39;ll quickly go over the language itself in a single module and then we&#39;ll jump right in to building a real web application with Dart and the Dart libraries. You&#39;ll learn how to add Dart code to a web page in a very similar fashion that you probably have been doing with JavaScript. You&#39;ll also see the power of the Dart language and libraries as we explore some of the advanced data binding and templating features in the Dart Web UI library. We&#39;ll wrap up the course by going over some of the advanced features of Dart, like concurrency using isolates instead of threads, and mixins that allow us to get the benefits of inheritance without many of the drawbacks. So, if you&#39;ve been interested in Dart, but haven&#39;t wanted to invest the time into learning a whole new programming language, this course will show you how much about the Dart language you probably already know and get you building a real application quickly. The goal of this course is to make it as easy and painless as possible to get started with Dart and decide if it is something you want to learn more about." >Introduction To Building Web Applications With Dart</a>

As machine learning is a very vast area, this course will be targeted more towards one of the machine learning methods which is neural networks. The course will try to make a base foundation first by explaining machine learning through some real world applications and various associated components. In this course, we&#39;ll take one of the open source machine learning framework for .NET, which is ENCOG. The course will explain how ENCOG fits into the picture for machine learning programming. Then we&#39;ll learn to create various neural network components using ENCOG and how to combine these components for real world scenarios. We&#39;ll go in detail of feed forward networks and various propagation training methodologies supported in ENCOG. We&#39;ll also talk about data preparation for neural networks using normalization process. Finally, we will take a few more case studies and will try to implement tasks of classification &amp; regression. In the course I will also give some tips &amp; tricks for effective &amp; quick implementations of neural networks in real world applications." >Introduction to Machine Learning with ENCOG 3</a>

Last, it is a statically typed language without the typical type ceremony, which allows for less runtime errors with minimal code. This course will teach enough of the basics of Scala to enable you to start writing less boiler-plate code and focus more on business problems. It will get you started from the ground up and quickly familiarize you with some of the most powerful features of this modern language.

        <a href="/training/Courses/TableOfContents/python-fundamentals" title="Python Fundamentals gets you started with Python, a dynamic language popular for web development, big data, science, and scripting. What’s so great about Python? Python is powerful. The Python language is expressive and productive, it comes with a great standard library, and it’s the center of a huge universe of wonderful third-party libraries. With Python you can build everything from simple scripts to complex applications, you can do it quickly, and you can do it with fewer lines of code than you might think possible. But for many people those reasons take back-seat to something more important: Python is fun! Python’s readable style, quick edit-and-run development cycle, and “batteries included” philosophy mean that you can sit down and enjoy writing code rather than fighting compilers and thorny syntax. As your experiments become prototypes and your prototypes become products, Python makes the experience of writing software not just easier but truly enjoyable. In the words of Randall Munroe, &quot;Come join us! Programming is fun again!&quot;" >Python Fundamentals</a>

Ben then reads and understands the test code, then rewrites it to be clearer and more maintainable. He then sets his sights on the implementation code where he changes a bit of the API, then tackles a particularly terse method. The result is a dozen insights into when, where, and how to refactor code confidently. This isn&#39;t a rehearsed presentation, but a live discovery of code for the first time.

This video series starts by teaching you the basic RSpec syntax and the best ways to use it, and then moves on to intermediate topics such as mocks, stubs, and error cases, and then adds Ruby on Rails into the equation, covering factories, code organization, and running tests quickly." >RSpec the Right Way</a>

In about 80 minutes, he writes a prototype for retrieving data and serializing it for use on a client. In the second part, he finishes the project started in Part 1 by building a front end for a scoring system using Ember.js. In about an hour, he builds a search field that retrieves data from the server, calculates a score, and displays it. Note - this course uses an ancient version of Ember.js. If you&#39;re a fan of Yehuda Katz or want to watch him work through a simple app, check out this course.

With the popularity and enthusiasm around these frameworks also comes confusion about their security profiles and associated risks. Often, when developers build client apps with server back ends they approach the application as though they control the entire ecosystem. Assumptions are often made that the client they built will only ever talk to the server side APIs they built in the way they designed them. This view often overlooks the risk of an attacker circumventing the client controls and executing calls directly against the server side A9PI outside the intended scope of the application. Much of this course is about helping developers understand where the security boundaries of client side frameworks begin and end. It does this by demonstrating common implementation patterns using Angular and illustrating where security weaknesses may be introduced. It also highlights specific defenses implemented by Angular, and demonstrates the mechanics of how they work, and how they may be misconfigured to introduce risks." >AngularJS Security Fundamentals</a>

Secondly, the rapidly emerging “Internet of Things” which promises to bring connectivity to common devices we use in our everyday lives. In the rush to push these products to market, developers are often taking shortcuts on security and leaving online services vulnerable to attack. The risks are not are obvious as they may be in traditional browser based web apps, but they’re extremely prevalent and attackers know how to easily identify them.

        <a href="/training/Courses/TableOfContents/secure-account-management-fundamentals" title="A fundamental component of many modern day applications is the ability to create and manage user accounts. So many of the services we use every day as consumers and build as developers depend on the ability for customers to register, login, and then perform tasks under their identity. However, every day we see a barrage of attacks against poorly implemented account management facilities. These range from brute force attacks against the login to the impersonation of authenticated users, to the cracking of breached passwords. Often, weaknesses in account management facilities are simply due to the developers not having thought through the potential risks from a hacker&#39;s mindset. This course demonstrates how attackers think and exploit these weaknesses. There are numerous high-profile precedents including the celebrity iCloud photo hack, GitHub account attacks and Dropbox credential disclosure. In some of these cases, oversights in secure account management practices left systems unnecessarily vulnerable whilst in others, good practices undoubtedly mitigated the scale of the damage caused. This course regularly refers to real world examples – both good and bad – as a means of illustrating risks and the effectiveness of security controls." >Secure Account Management Fundamentals</a>

The new workflow platform is implemented with a new product called Workflow Manager 1.0. This course builds off what you learned in the SharePoint 2013 Workflow - Fundamentals and the SharePoint 2013 Workflow - Advanced Topics courses. In this course you will learn how to work with web services in your SharePoint 2013 workflows to meet today&#39;s business requirements. You will learn how to read and write to anonymous web services and how to authenticate and interact with the SharePoint 2013 REST API from both SharePoint Designer and Visual Studio when the provided activities don&#39;t provide the necessary tools to complete the task. Finally you will also learn how to communicate with secured web services including third party OAuth secured services and how to deploy, and interact, with your own custom secured web services." >SharePoint 2013 Workflow - Web Services</a>

Next, you&#39;ll discover what&#39;s new when it comes to using PowerShell V3 with SharePoint 2013.

And finally, sometimes the out of the box cmdlets just aren&#39;t enough - so we&#39;ll teach you how to create your own custom cmdlets that you can deploy to your SharePoint Farm.

As we go to build such solutions, we have found people quickly come to the big question: Web, or native app? In this course we will try to tear apart that question and get to the nuance that lies within.We will use computing history to learn from past mistakes and triumphs. We will then look into the advantages and flaws of the technology behind the Web and native platforms. We quickly bisect the fact that there are two sides to the question: Using the Web as a delivery platform? Or, as an experience platform? At Walmart Labs we have gone through these challenges, so we use our own example to add to other case studies to give an overview of the problem and how you can hope to use the Web and native together more as peanut butter and jelly." >Web vs Apps: The Big Picture</a>

Two of the biggest barriers to getting started are picking an automation tool and developing a framework for writing the tests. This course explores how to use the popular browser automation framework, Selenium, to create automated tests for web applications. We will examine using Selenium to directly record from within a Firefox browser, as well as using C# to automate the web browser using Selenium&#39;s API. We will also explore how to distribute tests over multiple machines using Selenium Server&#39;s grid capabilities. The course concludes with the implementation of a simple, maintainable framework for testing a web application using Selenium." >Automated Web Testing with Selenium</a>

This course is about how you could hold regular &quot;Coding Dojo&quot; meetings where you and your team can focus on improving your practical coding skills together. You&#39;ll be practicing in a safe, collaborative environment, using simple &quot;Code Kata&quot; examples. It becomes a space away from your normal work, where you can discuss coding practices like Test Driven Development and Refactoring, then later bring your new skills to bear in your production code. This course should give you; the coding dojo organizer, the supporting materials you need to start a Coding Dojo, and get everyone who attends to practice better software development techniques. It should also allow you to improve your communication and facilitation skills, and help your team to gel. Kent Beck once said &quot;I&#39;m not a great programmer, I&#39;m just a good programmer with great habits&quot;. What are you doing to improve your coding habits?

Many times some of what needs to be tested and how it needs to be tested gets lost in the translation. Wouldn&#39;t it be easier if the business person or QA person could just create the test cases themselves and still have them automated? FitNesse is a great testing framework that allows you to do just that. Using FitNesse, a developer creates test fixtures that allow non-technical people to write tests just by modifying a Wiki page. In this course I&#39;ll walk you through the steps to get set up and running with FitNesse. I&#39;ll show you how to use the older Fit style of creating test and the newer Slim style and we&#39;ll cover both Java and .NET, since FitNesse can work with either platform. FitNesse itself happens to be a Wiki, so it is also an excellent tool for documenting a system and the tests that go with it in a format that changes with the system. So if you&#39;ve been thinking about learning about an acceptance test framework, or you&#39;ve been wanted to learn FitNesse, but have always thought it had a steep learning curve, this course will help you to get started quickly and understand how FitNesse works." >Creating Acceptance Tests With FitNesse</a>

        <a href="/training/Courses/TableOfContents/automated-testing-framework-selenium" title="Learning how to use a tool like Selenium to create automated tests is not enough to be successful with an automation effort. You also need to know how to build an automation framework that can support creating tests that are not so fragile that they constantly break. This is the real key to success in any automation effort. In this course, I will reveal every secret I know from creating several successful automation frameworks and consulting on the creation of others. I will show you exactly, step-by-step how to create your own automation framework and I will explain to you the reasoning behind everything we are doing, so you can apply what you learn to your own framework. We’ll start off this course by going over the basics of automation and talking about why it is so important as well as discuss some of the common reasons for success and failure. Then, I’ll take you into the architecture of an automation framework and show you why you need to pay careful attention to the structure of any framework you build and give you some of the underlying design principles I use when creating an automation framework. After that we’ll be ready to start creating a framework. In the next few modules, I’ll show you how to create a real automation framework capable of automating the Wordpress blogging platform administrative console. We’ll start off by creating smoke tests and using those smoke tests to build out our initial framework. Then, we’ll expand the capabilities of our framework as we create more tests and learn how to use techniques like dummy data generators to make our tests as simple and easy to read as possible. Finally, I’ll take you through some best practices and tips that cover topics like scaling out, working in Agile environments and other important issues you are likely to face. If you are responsible for an automation project for a web application or you want to start using automation, you’ll definitely want to check this course out." >Creating an Automated Testing Framework With Selenium</a>

You will learn about UTC, daylight saving time, time zones, and calendar systems. You will also learn how date and time values are represented and manipulated in various programming languages. We will look closely at the different kinds of time zone data, and discuss various fallacies and gotchas that are commonly encountered. We will deep dive into how date and time are handled in the .NET Framework, and in JavaScript. We will also look at various libraries that make things slightly more bearable.

Applications need to be able to grow without being totally rewritten. Sure, there eventually comes a time when every app needs a major overhaul, but if applications are written to be extensible in the first place, the overhaul can be performed in pieces; and in the meantime, new features can be added or existing features changed without bringing the app down. This &quot;extensibility&quot; in our design is becoming more and more important every day as software shops compete with each other for work and even with other countries. There have been many articles and design documents written on things like inversion of control in the UI tiers. Many books have dedicated chapters to injecting objects into MVC controllers or WPF ViewModels, but not many have focused on the meat of a system, the business tiers. These are the tiers that are accessible to the UI of a system, more than one in many cases. And these are the tiers that can be most volatile and subject to change and enhancement. In this course, I&#39;ll show you some of my favorite extensibility designs and techniques which will let you write software in building blocks that can be connected and interconnected in different ways. I&#39;ll keep most of my focus on the business tiers, which despite the lack of user-centric visual glamour, is where you get to exercise the most creativity. You&#39;ll be able to roll out applications and continuously add or change things without affecting the core infrastructure in place. To me, this not only makes the software better, but more fun to write!" >Developing Extensible Software</a>

        <a href="/training/Courses/TableOfContents/uml-introduction" title="Seldom does a software project of any size get built by only one person. Most often many different people, with different skills work together to build the solution. It is not uncommon to have the technology not be the most challenging part of the project, but rather it is often the lack of clear communication between the project team members. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) helps the team members to communicate clearly and precisely. The UML includes several diagrams and models that support the design of different aspects of the solution. If each member of the team is able to understand those models that are useful to them they are more likely to understand each other, and the challenges and risks of different understandings and views of the solution are minimized. In this course we review the need for this clear communication. We discuss several of the common diagrams that teams use to model a software solution and identify some of the team members that most commonly use the diagram. The UML is very large and there is much that can be done with it beyond what is covered in this introductory course. But having this basic understanding of the common models can reduce many of the challenges faced by project teams." >Introduction to UML</a>

So why use an engineering approach to software? Quite simply, because the alternative would be to use an ad-hoc or disordered approach.

Either way, this course will teach you what you need to know to not only get started with JUnit, but to master all of the features of the JUnit framework. In this course, we&#39;ll start out by learning the basics of JUnit and how to create some basic unit tests. Then, we&#39;ll go into some of the lesser known advanced features of JUnit that will really help you write elegant tests with less code. After that, I&#39;ll show you how to integrate JUnit with your existing Ant or Maven build system and how you can automate the creation of JUnit reports. Finally, we&#39;ll wrap things up by going beyond the basic uses of JUnit by learning how to use stubs and mocks to really isolate classes and we&#39;ll also learn how to use JUnit for more than just unit testing. By the end of this course, you&#39;ll be a JUnit pro and will have a handful of useful tools and techniques you can use to make the most of the JUnit framework.

It is certainly a plus to have these two goals met, but that is not sufficient to make the application really good. We can learn the most about one application by reading the source code of particular methods embedded deep inside of it. A common for loop often reveals more about the design than the whole diagram depicting responsibilities of an application layer in which it is located. The devil is in the details. The best of all intentions in design fails miserably when the low-profile design of small, seemingly unimportant classes is misconceived. In this course, the order of decisions is sorted bottom-up. It is the small class to which we pay attention the most. Only when all things are in place at the microscopic level can we discuss responsibilities of layers, isolation of modules and other high profile topics. The result is a well-built, easily testable and easily maintainable application." >Improving Testability Through Design</a>

It begins by showing how to use Mercurial as a local, stand-alone source control system. Then it introduces working with a Mercurial server by showing how to get files into and out of a hosted repository. Finally it shows how to create and merge branches. Topics covered include source control, distributed version control, branching, cloning and merging. After viewing this course, the viewer should have the basic skills necessary to evaluate Mercurial as a replacement for their existing version control system, or to be productive using Mercurial if joining a team already using it." >Mercurial Fundamentals</a>

We look at DVCS from the perspective of three different development scenarios - single developer projects, open source projects, and commercial projects. This course includes lots of diagrams that will help you understand the &quot;DAG,&quot; which is the way DVCS store their history, and there are demos of using both Mercurial and Git.

The understanding and knowledge of who does what and when is just as important as making sure that your database servers are up and running. What&#39;s more, DBAs do not manage just one instance of SQL Server nowadays, but hundreds or even thousands. In addition to that, sometimes there is a need to check for or even enforce a specific business rule or configuration and thus prevent someone violating some specific requirements, for example. All of those tasks can be quite time-consuming or even impossible to accomplish except if Policy-Based Management is used. With this course, the learner will be prepared to face the challenge of auditing and enforcing rules across many database servers, without spending a lot of hours working on these tasks." >Auditing SQL Server With Policy-Based Management</a>

It&#39;s critical that your application performs well under load, keeps the user data secure, and is able to be installed and upgraded easily. This course explains all these considerations using a layered approach that ties into stages in the development lifecycle. The course begins by examining database design and schema considerations, plus general best practices around security using roles, logins, and users. It then explains and demonstrates numerous aspects of T-SQL coding where choices can be made to make the code and application more efficient, and avoid common performance pitfalls. Application and code testing is then addressed, along with figuring out the hardware, software, and SQL Server requirements that must be communicated to the users. The course ends by walking through the deployment phase, including common SQL Server and database configuration options that must be changed or left as the default value, and explaining how to ensure that application and database upgrades run smoothly. This course is perfect for developers who are involved in the development lifecycle of applications that use SQL Server for data storage. The information in the course applies to all versions from SQL Server 2005 onward." >Developing and Deploying SQL Server ISV Applications</a>

We first look at how the shift in technology trends established the need for a different breed of technologies. Columnar, or Column-Oriented, databases have become increasingly popular in data warehousing applications because they allow for better compression and multi-fold performance improvements, and we&#39;ll see how SQL Server 2014 implements this with clustered columnstore indexes. In addition, as technology makes a bigger shift in hardware to multi-core CPU architectures and large amounts of memory are even cheaper and more attainable, it&#39;s important for software to adjust and utilize these changes. We&#39;ll see how In-Memory OLTP addresses these trends and more, letting you create tables in memory, eliminating locks and implementing optimistic multi-version concurrency. This course discusses in depth In-Memory OLTP (memory optimized tables), previously known as Hekaton. We&#39;ll cover creating memory-optimized tables, loading data, durability and the affect that has on the transaction log. We&#39;ll also look at indexing in detail, explaining the new index types created specifically to support In-Memory OLTP and how and when to apply each type based on your use case and we&#39;ll discuss how In-Memory OLTP and Clustered Columnstore indexes can fit a variety of applications while comparing them with each other and traditional disk-based tables and indexes." >Optimizing OLTP and Data Warehousing with SQL Server 2014</a>

The bulk of the course describes architecture and design issues in both the application and the database that can affect scalability, along with demonstrations of some of the issues and detailed scripts to help you find the issues in the first place. The course ends with a section on common indexing problems that can drastically limit a workload&#39;s scalability, along with how to identify and fix them.

When it happens in your environment, do you know what to do? Will you realize you have corruption? Written and presented by the person who wrote SQL Server&#39;s consistency checking and repair tools, this course will show you what you need to know to detect and recover from most cases of database corruption. The course starts by explaining why timely corruption detection is so important, and then investigates the various causes of database corruption. You&#39;ll learn how to configure SQL Server to automatically detect when I/O errors occur, what consistency checks are, the DBCC commands to use to perform consistency checks, and how to configure SQL Server to perform consistency checks regularly. The course then moves on to interpreting the output from consistency checks so you&#39;ll know when you have corruption in your environment, plus whether and how the corruption limits your recovery options or not. Finally, the course ends with modules that describe and demonstrate how to recover from corruption using simple restore techniques and simple repair techniques. Packed with a wealth of information and practical, easy-to-follow demonstrations, this course will prepare you to detect and recover from database corruption when it happens to you. The course is applicable for all SQL Server versions from SQL Server 2005 onward, and for anyone responsible for SQL Server databases with any level of experience." >SQL Server: Detecting and Correcting Database Corruption</a>

This comprehensive course, written by someone who has actually worked on the SQL Server logging and recovery code itself, explains everything practical there is to know about how logging and recovery work, and how to avoid and recover from problems with the transaction log. The course follows a building-blocks approach, starting with a simple definition and example of how logging is used, and then covering transaction log architecture and log recorss themselves. Using this knowledge, the course then moves into details of checkpoint operations, general transaction log operations including log clearing and VLF management, and how recovery and crash recovery work. The three recovery models are described in detail, as well as how to create and configure transaction logs for optimal performance, including monitoring transaction log performance. The course ends with a detailed module on transaction log backups, tail-of-the-log-backups, and examining transaction log contents, and then a module on dealing with transaction log corruption and how logging and recovery are used in high-availability technologies. The course is perfect for anyone who has to manage SQL Server and wants to avoid common transaction log problems, as well as those looking for in-depth coverage of everything to do with the transaction log.

Knowing when to use each method is important and understanding how SQL Server works will demystify certain behaviors you may have seen but previously have been unable to explain. SQL Server can support any workload, any design, and any data requests but knowing exactly which one is the most beneficial to use can give you better long-term scalability, availability, and performance. Using the wrong method can cause more memory to be wasted and even result in parameter sniffing problems (where subsequent statements perform poorly because of the plan that’s been cached). This course will show you how each statement execution method works, how it’s cached, whether or not it wastes cache, and finally how to test and rewrite the statement to take better advantage of caching. Along the way we will also cover a variety of other necessary features and tools: estimates, statistics, and heuristics; how to analyze query plans; some indexing strategies to improve performance; and plan guides. This course is an absolute must for everyone that works with SQL Server and it’s also an introduction to concepts that will be built upon in future courses. This course is applicable to all SQL Server versions from SQL Server 2005 onward, and for SQL Server developers as well as anyone responsible for writing data access statements to SQL Server tables. You can have any level of experience to gain from this course but those of you who have experienced what seemed odd behavior/performance with your ad hoc statements will probably benefit the most!" >SQL Server: Optimizing Ad Hoc Statement Performance</a>

Their aim is that you have optimized and compiled code that resides in a cache to improve workload performance for subsequent executions. However, you might find that it does not always work out that way. The performance of a stored procedure is heavily dependent on how the plan is chosen and cached. If the plan is not optimal for subsequent executions it could cause performance to suffer greatly. In the end, you might suffer from what is known as parameter-sniffing-problems where the optimal plan for a procedure varies based on the parameters supplied.

Choosing the right data types when you&#39;re designing your columns, tables, and indexes is really critical. Using the wrong data type can cause more space to be required, affecting data density in memory, database and backup size, transaction log efficiency, and more. It&#39;s even more important when you&#39;re choosing your clustering keys, as the wrong choice there can cause nonclustered index sizes to balloon dramatically. It can even affect the performance of queries, when incompatible data types are used in comparisons and cause very costly operations to take place. This course will show you how to make the right choices and avoid all of these problems. It starts by explaining the various data structures that are used to store columns and rows, and how they can be affected by data type choice. Then it shows how data type choice factors into clustered and nonclustered index key choice. Finally it describes the implicit conversion and probe residual problems that can occur from mismatched data types used in queries. Packed with a wealth of information and practical, easy-to-follow demonstrations, this course will show you how to make the RIGHT choices to make sure you avoid all these common problems. The course is applicable for all SQL Server versions from SQL Server 2005 onward, and for SQL Server developers and anyone responsible for designing and creating SQL Server tables and indexes, with any level of experience." >SQL Server: Why Physical Database Design Matters</a>

However, before solving the problem, you need to understand it. After an introduction to temporal problems and constraints, you will learn how to implement the solutions. Many solutions are much simpler with the help of a special Interval CLR data type. Additional relational operators PACK and UNPACK are handy as well. Of course, these two operators do not exist in the Transact-SQL language. You will learn how to implement them with help of other language elements. Having a SQL Server solution for a problem does not mean the job is done. Of course, the next immediate issue is performance. Temporal queries that involve intervals are typically very IO and CPU intensive. For example, a test for overlapping intervals was solved with inefficient queries for years. However, a handful of solutions with fast queries was developed recently. This course introduces five different methods to get efficient queries that search for overlapping intervals, one of the most complex temporal problems. Of course, these solutions can be implemented for other temporal problems as well. All the solutions presented should work on any edition of SQL Server from 2008 to 2014." >Working With Temporal Data in SQL Server</a>

The SQL Server: Detecting and Correcting Database Corruption course showed you what you need to know to detect and recover from most cases of database corruption and this course will take you to the next level of knowledge and capabilities. The course starts by explaining in depth how DBCC CHECKDB processes databases and how you can tune the performance of DBCC CHECKDB to make it run as fast as possible. You&#39;ll then learn about some undocumented DBCC commands, such as DBCC PAGE and DBCC WRITEPAGE, which can be invaluable when investigating and repairing corruption. The course then moves on to dealing with transaction log corruption, such as using EMERGENCY mode and how to re-attach damaged databases, and more advanced restore techniques, including how to analyze the transaction log to find the point to restore to and how to perform a tail-of-the-log backup using a different SQL Server instance. Finally, the course ends with advanced repair techniques, including how to deal with corrupt metadata by manually editing system tables, how to salvage data from backups and nonclustered indexes, and the ultimate in advanced recovery techniques: manually editing a database using DBCC WRITEPAGE. Packed with a wealth of information and practical, easy-to-follow demonstrations, this course will prepare you for dealing with out-of-the-ordinary corruption problems. The course is applicable to all SQL Server versions from SQL Server 2005 onward, and for more experienced SQL Server professionals." >SQL Server: Advanced Corruption Recovery Techniques</a>

        <a href="/training/Courses/TableOfContents/meet-mercurial" title="Many developers have embraced distributed source code control as a faster, more agile way of managing projects both online and offline. Mercurial is not only fast, it also provides a smooth transition for developers who are already comfortable with Subversion&#39;s basic command set. And it gives you easy access to common functionality without resorting to cryptic command-line flags. It works well on all major operating systems, including Microsoft Windows. Learn it quickly with our Mercurial tutorial! Major projects such as Python and Mozilla use Mercurial. Project hosting options abound, including Google Code, BitBucket, and even GitHub via the experimental hg-git! In this course, Dan Benjamin draws on years of experience with source code control systems to get you up to speed with Mercurial. In fact, he was so impressed with Mercurial that he converted all his personal projects and is now using it daily. Even if you primarily use Git or another distributed system, this course will help you for those times when you want to clone or contribute to a project hosted in Mercurial. And maybe you&#39;ll even learn some tips to take back to your SCM of choice." >Meet Mercurial</a>

Rather than focusing solely on aesthetics, he considers the context of the existing site and thinks through how his designs fit into the average user&#39;s workflow. In this course, he designs a prototype for a theoretical feature at PeepCode: a bulk video download system. Kyle will walk through: thinking through a UI problem, using aesthetic and workflow context when designing a new feature, using small tools together for collaborating on designs (Skitch, Campfire, Preview, Photoshop), designing just enough detail for the first iteration of a feature, educating users about new features, finding the sweet spot between functionality and simplicity. Kyle spends most of his time in Photoshop and the Webkit web inspector. Both designers and developers will benefit from watching how he works." >Play by Play: Kyle Neath</a>

He was one of the first people to experiment with writing mobile-specific web applications for the iPhone. In this live session, we asked him to design a mobile UI for a theoretical trail hiking directions application. Neven shows that experienced designers and developers go far beyond merely learning the latest software APIs or using the newest features of hardware. He applies his skills of analysis toward understanding the task, then finds relevant language to communicate the direction in which he wants to take it. Neven is not only a skilled designer, he&#39;s also an eloquent teacher.

In this 72 minute video, you&#39;ll watch Ryan sketch out a user interface for a single page of a web application. He doesn&#39;t write any code (that comes next), but he thinks through the issues and follows several possible paths before coming to rest on a solution. You&#39;ll benefit from watching him learn about the problem domain, evaluate his own ideas, and combine user interface metaphors into a plan for a prototype. He describes his process as clearly as he thinks about it, which makes for a great video whether you&#39;re a front-end designer or a back-end programmer.

In this series, we give talented developers a project and talk through it as they design and develop in real time for about 2 hours. Although neither John nor Ward are graphic designers, they are skilled software developers all the way from the backend database to the front end user experience. In this live session, they discuss project requirements with a client, then go deep into exploring possibilities for the application&#39;s screens, buttons, text, and workflow. At the end they begin coding a prototype with AngularJS. Whether you are a designer, a developer, or a project manager, you&#39;ll appreciate their wise insights and their skills in pulling a problem apart to see how a solution will work in the hands of the end user. Along the way you&#39;ll appreciate their sense of humor and camaraderie as they think through this problem out loud.

In this course you will learn how you can use Microsoft CodedUI test technology to build UI test automation projects that will help you run tests via the user interface of your application. This enables you to speed up the validation of fully functional scenarios on your application which is an important step to enable continuous delivery. CodedUI integrates with the Microsoft ALM tool suite, and can help you build insights in your application quality on a daily basis. In this course we look in detail how CodedUI works. We will start with Record and Playback. Then we look at how to build your UI tests by hand coding against the CodedUI object model. Then we spend a good deal of time looking at how you can build a very good maintainable UI test automation project. Since a good UI test will live as long as the application it is therefore crucial to learn how to build a Test automation framework for your application that is maintainable, and that will keep up with changes in the application throughout its lifecycle. We will also look at analyzing playback failures and cross browser playback. This course concludes by looking at how to build key word driven UI tests by using data driven excel sheets to manage and drive your test scenarios." >Test Automation with CodedUI</a>

Often they need to take over projects for which no database code can be found. Then once they&#39;ve created code, they have to track changes manually in order to provide the DBA with change scripts. All the while thinking, &quot;there&#39;s got to be a better way!&quot; Fear not .Net Developer, it&#39;s Data Dude to the rescue! Originally code named &quot;Data Dude&quot;, Visual Studio Database Projects havef gone through several name changes since it&#39;s inception with VS 2005. In Visual Studio 2010 it became another project type, a Database Project. In this series you will learn how to harness the power of the Database Project to create a new database, or reverse engineer the code for an existing database. You will learn how to refactor, and let Visual Studio keep track of the changes, to let it automatically generate change and deployment scripts. Finally, you&#39;ll learn how to take advantage of Visual Studio&#39;s powerful data generation capabilities to create realistic test data." >Visual Studio 2010 Database Projects</a>

Moreover, an easier task is to transaction-enable .NET applications. .NET provides you with the classes to do just that. If that is the case, then why a course about transactions? Well, that is because just like everything else in programming, you need to understand the architecture, the underground of whatever seems to be an easy task. Only then can you design solutions as opposed to only coding them. WCF transactions are built from ground up around .NET transactions. This is hardly surprising anyway, since WCF is a .NET technology. However, this sums up as follows: you need to understand how .NET does transactions in order to utilize them in WCF." >Understanding .NET and WCF Transactions</a>

What about Web API, you ask? WCF and Web API are drastically different platforms with different goals and purposes. WCF offers the richest and most robust programming model for exposing services with characteristics and capabilities not available in any other messaging technology. Capabilities like state-management, callback eventing, and transaction handling. In this course, I&#39;ll teach you WCF from beginning to end. You&#39;re getting absolutely everything you will need to get the job done in a service oriented environment and to take advantage of all the richness the WCF platform has to offer.

We will focus on Java&#39;s JAX-WS specification as it is mature and accepted as a standard approach for web service implementation. This course has several objectives. Upon completion, you will be able to describe the Apache CXF architecture in detail. You will see the benefits of using CXF and understand the drivers for using it in your applications. You will be able to create a CXF web project using Maven. You will be able to use CXF for implementing a contract-first web service endpoint with a JAX-WS front-end. You will be able to implement unit tests, error handling, and interceptor logic for a CXF web service. Finally, you will be able to implement a web service client using CXF. This course is primarily intended for Java developers looking to implement web services. It will also be useful for technical and solution architects who are investigating technologies to leverage for implementing web services. It is recommended that you are proficient with Java and have an understanding of the Spring Framework core project. To best understand the drivers for using Apache CXF for your web service implementation, we will cover a brief history of the Java specifications, including JAX-RPC, JAX-WS, and JAX-RS. While the course will not cover CXF&#39;s capabilities around JAX-RS, we will cover the key architecture components that back the JAX-RS front-end. While viewing the course, you will be able to follow along with the many demonstrations it includes. Each demonstration will build on the previous demonstration to assure you a fluid experience." >Building JAX-WS Web Services with Apache CXF</a>

        <a href="/training/Courses/TableOfContents/building-windows-store-business-applications-prism" title="When building client business applications for WinRT and the Windows Store in XAML you need to design your application for maintainability and testability. To achieve this, you need to design your application following principles of separation of concerns and loose coupling, which usually means employing the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern in XAML. In addition, you have to learn how to leverage the new features of the Windows Runtime (WinRT) platform to ensure a great user experience, but have the code that drives that experience in the right places in your application following the MVVM pattern. In this course you will learn how to do that by learning how to leverage the Microsoft patterns and practices guidance &quot;Prism for Windows Runtime&quot; directly from a member of the Prism team. You will learn how to separate your Pages into Views and ViewModels following the MVVM pattern and integrate nicely with the WinRT navigation system and application lifecycle of suspend/terminate/resume. You&#39;ll learn how to manage dependencies and communicate between loosely coupled components in your application. You will see how to validate user input, both on the client side and through service calls to a back end, as well as how to display those errors to the user. You learn how to call Web API services and how to do simple authentication and authorization with those services. Finally you will learn how to leverage Windows Runtime platform features including Search charm, Settings charm flyout panels, and Live Tiles." >Building Windows Store Business Apps with Prism</a>

In this course we learn how to work with application data, that is, working data that is created and accessed by your app on a continuous basis. Traditionally, app data has been local, but Metro blurs the distinction between local and remote data by making things such as cloud storage and app-to-app integration an integral part of both the user and developer experiences. This course looks at accessing files, local and remote, as a content source for our apps; it explores app data storage and roaming as well as the settings contract; and it takes an in-depth look at app-to-app sharing through the sharing contract. Before doing so, however, it starts with a fresh look at the UI side of things, including Metro controls and data binding. After watching this course, you should feel comfortable accessing, listing, updating, roaming and sharing data in your metro apps." >Windows 8 Metro Application Data</a>

When developing Windows Store Apps, you can use WinRT&#39;s Data Binding to bind the User Interface of your App to that data. With Data Bindings, there&#39;s no need to create Event Handlers to synchronize the data between different Controls in your UI, instead the Data Binding will do that job for you. The Data Binding-infrastructure of XAML-based frameworks is the base for the famous Model-View-ViewModel pattern (MVVM). This course teaches you how to use Data Bindings with all the tips and tricks you need to know. You&#39;ll learn how to create Data Bindings in XAML and C#, how to debug Data Bindings, how to use different data sources for a Data Binding like Dependency Properties, .NET Properties, Resources, relative Sources, and Collections. Beside that, you&#39;ll learn how to render your data-objects with DataTemplates, how to use the WinRT-Data Controls like ListView and GridView, and how to create Design-Time data. Throughout this course you&#39;ll see many demonstrations that demonstrate best practices, like grouping with CollectionViews, using a Semantic Zoom, implementing an Incremental Loading of data, using a ViewModelLocator, creating Design-Time-Data in Blend, and many more." >Windows Store Apps - Data Binding in Depth</a>

This edition of Play by Play is a deep dive into cloud security with one of the leading security experts in the industry, Mark Russinovich, CTO of Microsoft Azure. Mark Minasi asks the difficult questions that every DevOps Engineer, Infrastructure Architect, and SysAdmin wonders when considering moving to the cloud. Is my data secure from bad guys? Is it safe from Microsoft? Are they mining customer data? Once we move virtual machines into the cloud, is there anything we can do as administrators, or that Microsoft can do to make our systems secure? Learn what Microsoft is doing to ensure security and how Azure differs from other cloud services in this Play by Play." >Play by Play: Azure Security with Mark Russinovich</a>

However, working with Azure from a device comes with challenges, such as dealing with HTTP-based communication and access control. The Windows Azure Toolkit for Windows Phone was created by people from Microsoft to simplify make mobile cloud scenarios for Windows Phone developers, through a set of services and tools that greatly facilitate performing common tasks involved in working with Azure tables, blobs and queues. This course, takes an in-depth and hands-on look at leveraging Azure storage services from a Windows Phone application, by exploring and building on top of the toolkit. Along the way, we introduce each of the Azure storage types, and we learn about the programming interfaces they expose and how to work with them directly and through the toolkit’s architecture." >Building Windows Phone Applications with Azure</a>

        <a href="/training/Courses/TableOfContents/wpf-data-binding-in-depth" title="The data binding capabilities of WPF are one of the most powerful parts of the XAML platform. Data binding allows you to keep your XAML UI definition loosely coupled from the logic and data access that gets data into the application that will be used for display purposes. You can use data binding to build rich, interactive, beautifully designed user interfaces that are driven by data of many types. In this course you will learn how to leverage all the features of data binding and will learn enough to feel comfortable tackling everything from simple to complex data binding scenarios. You&#39;ll learn about what kinds of data sources you can work with, all the features that the Bindings themselves support, and how to use DataTemplates to provide a custom, reusable XAML rendering of your data objects. You&#39;ll learn how to use design time features in Visual Studio to generate data bound UIs or hook up existing ones, and you&#39;ll learn how to use the validation features to validate input data and present errors to the user. Along the way, you&#39;ll see some demos that use the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern and others that do not so you can see the power of data binding regardless of the UI patterns that you follow." >WPF Data Binding in Depth</a>

You can extend elements that are part of the core XAML libraries, 3rd party controls, or even your own controls all using a set of pre-built behaviors or by building your own custom behaviors.

You&#39;ll learn how to get highly productive quickly by using the pre-built Blend SDK and Behaviors SDK built-in behaviors, as well as how to build custom behaviors from scratch for more specialized scenarios.

        <a href="/training/Courses/TableOfContents/xaml-layout-in-depth" title="This course is about layout in XAML-based applications. It focuses on all XAML platforms like WPF, WinRT and Silverlight. In this course, you&#39;ll learn how the layout process works, and how to build custom panels. You&#39;ll see how the different layout properties of elements like Width, Height, Alignments and Margin behave and when they have an effect and when they do not. After those basics, this course focuses on the different Panels available in XAML. You&#39;ll learn about the common Panels Grid, StackPanel and Canvas, but also about the VirtualizingStackPanel that is used by some ItemsControl for UI-Virtualization. This course also shows you how to use the WPF-specific Panels WrapPanel and DockPanel and the WinRT-specific Panel VariableSizedWrapGrid. After the Panels, we look at Transformations to rotate, scale, skew and translate (move) your elements. You&#39;ll also learn how to work with Projections to give your elements a 3D-like effect. With the knowledge about the layout process, about the properties of elements, about Panels, and about Transformations and Projections in the backpack, we look at advanced topics. You&#39;ll learn about the shared size groups supported by the Grid in the WPF, how to change the Panel of an ItemsControl, how to animate a position change of the elements in a Panel, and many other interesting things. Throughout this course, your knowledge is applied to an MVVM-based WPF-application called FriendViewer. The course teaches you how to build the complete layout of that FriendViewer application, including a pinnable navigation, a loading-overlay, a UserControl to display a friend, and a main area that re-positions elements dynamically with an animation." >XAML Layout in Depth</a>

XPath is to XML documents like what SQL is to Relational Database Management Systems. The new W3C XPath 3.0 Recommendation gives us a language with amazing power resulting from its ability to define its own higher-order functions. If you think that you know XPath, but want to master version 3 of XSLT, XQuery, or future versions of XProc, XSD, Schematron, or pretty much any other modern programming language, then you need to start here. This course covers all new features of XPath 3.0: the XPath Data Model 3.0, operators, constructs, and expressions, along with the most powerful new feature - the function type. This course gives in-depth coverage of XPath 3.0 side-by-side with practical demos of their real-world applications." >The Evolution of XPath: What’s New in XPath 3.0</a>

Did you know there is LINQ to XML that allows you to process XML documents quickly and efficiently? If the answer is no to either of these two questions, then you need to watch this course. XML files are very common in today&#39;s programming world. You will most likely need to read files, write files and query XML within your applications. .NET provides a rich set of XML processing classes that you can use to perform all these functions. C# allows you to easily create, read and query XML files using XPath, LINQ to XML and other methods. In this course you will learn to read and write XML files using the various .NET classes. You will see some real-world uses of XML files in applications." >The Many Approaches to XML Processing in .NET Applications</a>
